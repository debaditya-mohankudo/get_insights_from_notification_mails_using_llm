In PR #7920, the integration with DV (Digital Vault) products was updated to use the Constants::PRODUCT_TYPE_DV constant.\n\nAdditionally, there are commits related to CSS updates (PR #7957) and adding links for German and Dutch customers (PR #7903), which suggests that there may be UI/UX improvements as well.\n\nIt's worth noting that PR #8003 mentions a fix for an issue with VMC not being visible in the card, which may indicate some changes to the way VMC is displayed or interacted with.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about these features and how they might impact your application, I can try to help you find more information or provide guidance on how to implement them."
